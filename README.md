Brief
You have been hired to build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging application. The client has asked for a responsive web application that allows users to view dynamic blog posts. You will use your own account that you create to act as the owner to test the functionality. When you submit the project, your client needs to be able to register, log in and manage their blog posts.
